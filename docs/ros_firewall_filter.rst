Synopsis
--------

This :ref:`ros_firewall_filter <ros_firewall_filter_module>` module provides management for RouterOS ``/ip firewall filter``.






Parameters
----------

  state (optional, any, merged)
    Overridden:
*  :ref:`ros_firewall_filter <ros_firewall_filter_module>` will remove any existing item in ``/ip firewall filter``
*  :ref:`ros_firewall_filter <ros_firewall_filter_module>` will create new item using value in the ``argument_spec``



  config (optional, list, None)
    A dictionary for L(ros_firewall_filter)


    action (optional, str, accept)
      Action to take if packet is matched by the rule:
- accept - accept the packet. Packet is not passed to next firewall rule.
- add-dst-to-address-list - add destination address to ` address
list </wiki/Manual:IP/Firewall/Address_list>`_ specified by ``address-list``
parameter
- add-src-to-address-list - add source address to ` address
list </wiki/Manual:IP/Firewall/Address_list>`_ specified by ``address-list``
parameter
- drop - silently drop the packet
- fasttrack-connection - process packets from a connection using FastPath by
enabling ` FastTrack </wiki/Manual:IP/Fasttrack>`_ for the connection
- jump - jump to the user defined chain specified by the value of ``jump-target``
parameter
- log - add a message to the system log containing following data: in-interface,
out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port-&gt;dst-ip:port and length of the
packet. After packet is matched it is passed to next rule in the list, similar
as ``passthrough``
- passthrough - if packet is matched by the rule, increase counter and go to
next rule (useful for statistics)
- reject - drop the packet and send an ICMP reject message
- return - passes control back to the chain from where the jump took place
- tarpit - captures and holds TCP connections (replies with SYN/ACK to the
inbound TCP SYN packet)



    address_list (optional, str, None)
      Name of the address list to be used. Applicable if action is
``add-dst-to-address-list`` or ``add-src-to-address-list``



    address_list_timeout (optional, str, 00:00:00)
      Time interval after which the address will be removed from the address list
specified by ``address-list`` parameter. Used in conjunction with
``add-dst-to-address-list`` or ``add-src-to-address-list`` actions
Value of ``00:00:00`` will leave the address in the address list forever



    chain (optional, str, None)
      Specifies to which chain rule will be added. If the input does not match the
name of an already defined chain, a new chain will be created.



    comment (optional, str, None)
      Descriptive comment for the rule.



    connection_bytes (optional, int, None)
      Matches packets only if a given amount of bytes has been transfered through the
particular connection. 0 - means infinity, for example
``connection-bytes=2000000-0`` means that the rule matches if more than 2MB has
been transfered through the relevant connection



    connection_limit (optional, int, None)
      Matches connections per address or address block after given value is reached.
Should be used together with connection-state=new and/or with tcp-flags=syn
because matcher is very resource intensive.



    connection_mark (optional, str, None)
      Matches packets marked via mangle facility with particular connection mark. If
no-mark is set, rule will match any unmarked connection.



    connection_nat_state (optional, str, None)
      Can match connections that are srcnatted, dstnatted or both. Note that
connection-state=related connections connection-nat-state is determined by
direction of the first packet. and if connection tracking needs to use dst-nat
to deliver this connection to same hosts as main connection it will be in
connection-nat-state=dstnat even if there are no dst-nat rules at all.



    connection_rate (optional, int, None)
      Connection Rate is a firewall matcher that allow to capture traffic based on
present speed of the connection. ` Read more
&gt;&gt; </wiki/Manual:Connection_Rate>`_



    connection_state (optional, str, None)
      Interprets the connection tracking analysis data for a particular packet:
- established - a packet which belongs to an existing connection
- invalid - a packet that does not have determined state in connection tracking
(usually - severe out-of-order packets, packets with wrong sequence/ack number,
or in case of resource overusage on router), for this reason invalid packet will
not participate in NAT (as only connection-state=new packets do), and will still
contain original source IP address when routed. We strongly suggest to drop all
connection-state=invalid packets in firewall filter forward and input chains
- new - the packet has started a new connection, or otherwise associated with a
connection which has not seen packets in both directions.
- related - a packet which is related to, but not part of an existing
connection, such as ICMP errors or a packet which begins FTP data connection
- untracked - packet which was set to bypass connection tracking in firewall `
RAW </wiki/Manual:IP/Firewall/Raw>`_ tables.



    connection_type (optional, str, None)

list </wiki/Manual:IP/Firewall/Address_list>`_



    dst_address_type (optional, str, None)
      Matches destination address type:
- unicast - IP address used for point to point transmission
- local - if dst-address is assigned to one of routers interfaces

- multicast - packet is forwarded to defined group of devices



    dst_limit (optional, int, None)
      Matches packets until a given rate is exceeded. Rate is defined as packets per
time interval. As opposed to the limit matcher, every flow has its own limit.
Flow is defined by mode parameter. Parameters are written in following format:

dst-address, src-and-dst-address, dst-address-and-port, addresses-and-dst-port)

``ipsec-policy=in,ipsec`` will match Gre packet, but rule ``ipsec-policy=in,none``
will match ESP packet.
